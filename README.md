This folder contains the bulk of the data science projects I worked on during my time at UCSD.

Assignment 1 uses both a Genetic Algorithm and Perceptron Descent to perform binary classification on a breast cancer dataset.

Assignment 2 uses a Genetic Algorithm to solve cases of the Traveling Salesman Problem.

Assignment 3 uses the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to find the global minimum of a non-convex function.
